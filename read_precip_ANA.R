  # 2) Extracting and stacking observations
  
  # The main quirk of the ANA data is that daily values are stored as sequential columns, 
  # and each row of the table corresponds to a month. All months have 31 days, and 
  # impossible dates are just empty. Also, entire months(rows) can be missing. The only safe way 
  # to extract values is to loop over each value, extract it, and date it.
  
  # Starting empty data frame that will receive precipitation and date values
  # It is a bad practice to grow dataframes inside a loop, but this is lightweight enough
  # that it makes little difference in performance
  st.data <- data.frame(dt = as.Date(NA), precip = as.numeric(NA))
  
  # This loop will take a row of daily values for a given month, create a vector of corresponding dates,
  # stack them side by side as columns in a data frame, and append them to main st.data output dataframe
  for(r in c(1:nrows)){ 
    rowdate <- in.data$Data[r] # get the date that defines the month for a given row
    rowmonth <- month(rowdate) # extract just the month
    rowyear <- year(rowdate) # extract the year
    d.prec <- unlist(as.vector(in.data[r,14:44])) # extract daily values
    d.date <- unlist(as.Date(paste(rowyear,rowmonth,c(1:31),sep="-"))) # creates actual dates
    st.data <- rbind(st.data, data.frame(dt = d.date,precip = d.prec)) # stacks values and dates and add to dataframe
  }

  # All date rows have 31 values, resulting in some impossible dates (e.g. 31st of february)  
  # They will become NAs, so we can just remove the rows with NA dates
  
  na.rows <- which(is.na(st.data$dt))
  st.data <- st.data[-(na.rows),]
    
  # create a new name for the resulting file
  out.name <- paste(out.folder,in.names[f],"_daily.csv", sep="")

  # save the resulting file
  write.csv(st.data,file=out.name,quote=F,row.names=F)
